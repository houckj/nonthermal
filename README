This distribution contains code for the S-Lang nonthermal module.

To build the code, you will need to ensure that you have the S-Lang
library installed.  It may be obtained from
http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/.

You must run the configure script before you can compile the module.
If the slang library is installed in a 
non-standard locations, then you will need to specify the location of
the library as arguments to the configure script.  For example,
suppose libslang.so is located in /home/bill/lib and its include file
slang.h is located in /home/bill/include. Then one would run the 
configure script using:

  ./configure --with-slanglib=/home/bill/lib \
              --with-slanginc=/home/bill/include

or, the shorter form which assumes a common pathname prefix for the
lib and include directories:

  ./configure --with-slang=/home/bill

You should also specify a location for the modules (*.so) and any associated
script (*.sl) files created by this package.  The default location for
the modules is in

   $prefix/lib/slang/modules/

Any .sl files will be installed in

   $exec_prefix/share/slsh/local-packages/

where the values of the variable $prefix defaults to /usr/local, and
that of $exec_prefix to the value of $prefix.  These values may be
changed using the --prefix and --exec-prefix configure script
parameters.  For example, to set the value of $prefix to /home/bill,
use

   ./configure --prefix=/home/bill ...

For more help using the configure script, run it using 

   ./configure --help

It is also a good idea to read the INSTALL.txt file located in this
directory.

Once the configure script has been run, you should inspect
the Makefile that it generated in the src directory.  Then building
and installing the library should involve nothing more than:

   make 
   make install

You may have to have root privileges to peform the last step.
